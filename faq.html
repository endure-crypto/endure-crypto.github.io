    <h1>How does share creation work?</h1>
    <p><em>Endure</em> generates a seed in your browser. The seed is then split into 9 shares using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>. Finally, the binary
      data is converted to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">mnemonic words</a>
      and rendered as ready-to-print files.</p>
    <p>Any 3 shares can be combined to form the original seed. It is recommended to use
      <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">HD wallets</a> derived from the seed.</p>
    <p>The code is pure javascript and has a minimal footprint. It was designed to be easy to audit. Seed
    generation happens in your browser and never leaves your computer.</p>

    <h1>How should I distribute the 9 shares?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Save 3 shares in 3 different locations for your own use (e.g. your home, your bag and your work).</li>
      <li>Ask 3 trusted friends or family members who live close to you to hold on to a share each.</li>
      <li>Finally, ask 3 friends or family members who live further away to hold on to the remaining shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How will people know how to use the shares?</h1>
    <p><em>Endure</em> provides a template you can use to print each share. The template contains instructions
      which have been tested with non-technical people. You may tweak the instructions to meet your specific needs.</p>

    <h1>One or more shares were lost, what should I do?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather 3 of the remaining shares.</li>
      <li>Recover the seed and the wallets.</li>
      <li>Create a new seed and new wallets. You'll have 9 new shares.</li>
      <li>Transfer your funds from the old wallets to the new wallets. Keep in mind that forks can result in your funds
        being available on different chains.</li>
      <li>Redistribute the 9 new shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Should I keep funds with an exchange?<div><small>(such as Coinbase, Square Cash, etc.)</small></div></h1>
    <p>Managing cryptocurrency wallets yourself or outsourcing it to an external entity involves various tradeoffs.</p>
    <p>The benefits of using a centralized exchange is that they might dedicate more resources to securely storing your
      assets than you can achieve yourself. In the past, many cryptocurrency institutions have lost their customers'
      funds with no hope of recovery. Which begs the question of whether trusting central entities defeats the purpose
      of a decentralized blockchain.</p>

    <h1>Is MultiSig better than Shamir Secret Sharing?</h1>
    <p>P2SH multisig transactions can achieve similar goals as Shamir Secret Sharing. The author however feels that
      getting multisig transactions right is more complicated. Shamir Secret Sharing can be used with existing wallets.
      In addition, the funds are not revealed until the shares are combined.

    <h1>Going the extra-mile.</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>When handling cryptocurrency, always use a secure device. E.g. wipe your phone before and after generating the
        shares.</li>
      <li>To reduce the risk of compromised printers, you can print blank templates and handwrite the shares.</li>
      <li>Hand people their shares on a USB drive (pdf file) as well as a paper copy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Tell me more...</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript is ubiquitous. This code is likely to work unchanged many years from now.</li>
      <li>The code is very minimal. The target is to keep it under 1000 LOC.</li>
      <li>The code is thoroughly commented.</li>
      <li>Unittests exercise every line of code.</li>
      <li>Defensive coding techniques were applied. For example, when generating the shares, the code verifies
        all permutations can be used to re-create the original seed.</li>
      <li>The author picked 3 shares among 9 but these values are configurable.</li>
    </ul>
