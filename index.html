      <p><em>Endure</em> creates a seed which is split in 9 shares.</p>
      <p><li>The seed is used to derive one or more Bitcoin deterministic wallets (or any other cryptocurrency).</li></p>
      <p><li>The 9 shares are distributed among you and trusted friends or family.</li></p>
      <p><em>Endure</em> gives you redundancy and
        protection against theft, fire, flood, etc. Additionally, your friends or family can recover your
        funds should misadventure strike you.</p>
